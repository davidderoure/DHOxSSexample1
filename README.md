# DHOxSSexample1
DHOxSS Computational Thinking Example 1 - Concordance

This example was used in the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School 2023, in the lecture on Monday 3rd July 2023 in the "Introduction to Computational Thinking" theme.  It is designed to illustrate a task that a computer can achieve much more readily than the human effort that was once required, i.e. a concordance - a (pre-Google) navigation aid for a text or collection of texts.

An extended version (called DHOxSSexample1extended) has been prepared for the hands-on session on Thursday 6th July, to be shared with the class via this github page.  This extended example includes code for ngrams and frequency statistics (in line with the 2nd Computational Thinking lectre, where the Google ngrams viewer was used) and also very preliminary sentiment analysis code (in response to a Q&A discussion).
