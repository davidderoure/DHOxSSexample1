# DHOxSSexample1
DHOxSS Computational Thinking Example 1 - Concordance

This example was used in the lecture on  Monday 3rd July 2023 in the "Introduction to Computational Thinking" theme of the Introduction to DH.  It is designed to illustrate a task that a computer can achieve much more readily than the human effort that was once required, i.e. a comcordance as a (pre-Google) navigatmon aid.
